## Usage


The two main scripts in the package are XSHcomp.py and XSHextract.py. These take care of combinations of individual exposures and 1D-extractions respectively. The idea is that the ESO X-shooter pipeline, http://www.eso.org/sci/software/pipelines/, is used to reduce all observations in STARE-mode, and then the scripts provided here, do combinations and extractions where the X-shooter pipeline behaves sub-optimally.
